# Edmunds-Car-Text-Analysis

In this assignment, I was acting as if I was an analytics consultant to a (i) brand manager, (ii) product manager and (iii) advertising manager. Our job was to give advice/insights to these individuals based on the analysis of social media conversations. 

- scraping.ipynb:
First we had to write a scraper using Selenium to fetch messsages posted in Edmunds.com discussion forums. We chose a general car forumn, and extracted 4100 posts into a .csv file. This code can be found in the file 'scraping.ipynb'. 

- Car Project.ipynb:
From there, we determined the most popular brands in the forumn, the brands that are closely associated with one another, the attributes brands were strongly associated with, and the most aspirational brand. This code can be found in the file 'Car Project.ipynb'.
